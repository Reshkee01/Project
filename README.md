House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project builds a House Price Prediction model using machine learning techniques to estimate property prices based on key features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, main road access, basement availability, and parking space. 
The dataset contains 545 entries and no missing or duplicate values, making it suitable for analysis. 
After performing exploratory data analysis, correlation study, and label encoding of categorical variables, the data is split into training and testing sets. 
A Linear Regression model is trained to understand how each feature influences the price, achieving an R² score of 0.51, meaning the model explains 51% of the variance in house prices.
Visualizations like heatmaps and scatter plots help interpret feature relationships. The model is also used to predict the price of a new house based on user-provided inputs. 
Overall, this project demonstrates the complete workflow of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction for real estate price estimation.
